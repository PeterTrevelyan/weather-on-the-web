# MetOcean Domain Working Group Telco 10/10/18 

## Attendees: 

Chris Little - Met Office

Tom Kralidis - Met Canada

Rich Carne - Met Office 

## Agenda:  

1. Changes to Feature data format<br>
Rich Carne - highlighted changes to the feature data format proposal that reflect discussions on the removal of Weather Icon and weather text to a separate annex. With the exception of changing the annex titles from "List of data types" to "List of parameter types" the proposed changes were accepted.<br>
We also discussed the distinction between data APIs and Product APIs where the former contain no business logic just pure data, and the latter provide business logic such as describing the previlant weather in graphical form (weather icon). The consensus was that we should prioritise the Data APIs. This assumption needs to be tested with a wider range from the domain working group.
  
2. Use Cases<br>
Still a number of outstanding PRs detailing new use cases for review. Any comments welcome. And any new Use Cases equally welcome.
Tom Kralidis will endavour to add a usecase based on the Public Weather Service business case.
  
3. AOB<br>
Chris Confirmed that a number of positive confirmartion emails regarding the charter had been sent to the DWG mailing list, suggesting we have the correct workpackages in weather on the web sub group. You have until the 19th October 2018 to make comment and object to the proposed charter.
