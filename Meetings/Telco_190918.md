# MetOcean Domain Working Group Telco 19/09/18

The meeting focused discussion on Point Feature Data encoding specification and format as proposed here: [Point Feature Data Format](https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web/blob/master/Specification/Feature%20Data%20Format%20proposal.md)

Acknowledge distinction between encoding format and API access pattern and that the group need to work on both.
API pattern would include option to select container encoding between GeoJSON, simple XML, CSV, GRIB, CovJSON, GML

Agreed Priority: 
  1. GeoJSON
  2. Simple features GML
  3. CSV
  4. CovJSON
  5. GRIB2

Question: Should we abstract the underlying dataset from the end user e.g. Obs and Forecast data returned in the same API call?
Group agreed on abstraction of Obs and forecast in the Point Feature API

Weather parameters:<br>
Discussion around the basic agreed set of parameters that must be supported, group questioned the need for Weather Icon and Weather Text
the proposal is also missing Missing Precipitation (Type, quantity, rate)
drop Weather Icon and weather text, include in a secondary list (Not mandatory)

Obs and forecast Abstraction:<br>
There is a need to identify if a particular parameter for a particular time step is from observed data or forecast, it was proposed that this be encoded in the process property for each parameter for each time step.
