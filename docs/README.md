The purpose of Weather on the Web is to clarify and formalise the weather related standards landscape that enables the development and use of weather based web services: 

- to determine how weather* information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; 
- to define a range of access patterns and encoding extensions** that cover a set of core use cases specified; 
- to identify and assess existing methods and tools; 
- to drive consensus on weather standards for the web;
- and to produce a set of best practice for use of weather information on the web.

Weather on the Web is an open iniative coordinated by the Met Ocean Domain Working Group, operating under the Open Geospatial Consortium. Our aim is to work in an open and collaborative way with National Met Services, weather providers, industry and acedemia to develop best practice and standards for weather information on the web.

Please participate in our first task to gather use-cases by suggesting new use cases or edits to existing and creating a pull request on our master use case document: [Use-Cases](https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web/tree/master/use-cases/use-cases.md)

A guide to the correct formatting of use cases can be found here: [Use case format](https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web/wiki/Propose-Use-Case-or-Requirement)

Pull requests should conform to our guidlines here: [propose a change](https://github.com/opengeospatial/weather-on-the-web/wiki/Propose-a-change-to-a-draft-wow-specification-document)

**Weather meaning any meteorological information that covers past present and future state of the atmosphere including observations and climatological data.*

***encoding extensions: for example specifying GeoJSON structures for describing weather at a specific location.*
