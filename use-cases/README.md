# Weather on the Web Use Cases & Requirements 

## 1. Abstract
This folder contains the use cases that demand a combination of weather information and a range of other data sources and techniques. It underpins the collaborative work of the Weather on the Web sub group of the Open Geospatial Consortium, Met Ocean Domain Working Group.

## 2. Introduction
The purpose of Weather on the Web is to clarify and formalise the weather related standards landscape that enables the development and use of weather based web services: 

- to determine how weather information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; 
- to define a range of access patterns and encoding extensions that cover a set of core use cases specified; 
- to identify and assess existing methods and tools; 
- to drive consensus on weather standards for the web;
- and to produce a set of best practice for use of weather information on the web.

This folder describes a set of evolving use cases which are the first steps of working towards these goals. Members of the Sub Group and other stakeholders are working collaborativly to define a number of use cases that describe how weather information on the Web could work. From these use cases, a number of requirements for further work are derived. In this folder, use cases, requirements and their relationships will be described. Requirements and use cases are also related to the deliverables of the Sub Group which are defined in the root readme.md file. The requirements described in this folder will be the basis for development of the other deliverables of the Sub Group.
