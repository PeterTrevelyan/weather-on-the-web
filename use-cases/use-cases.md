# Weather on the Web Use Cases & Requirements 

## 1. Abstract
This document describes use cases that demand a combination of weather information and a range of other data sources and techniques. It underpins the collaborative work of the Weather on the Web sub group of the Open Geospatial Consortium, Met Ocean Domain Working Group.

## 2. Introduction
The purpose of Weather on the Web is to clarify and formalise the weather related standards landscape that enables the development and use of weather based web services: 

- to determine how weather* information can best be integrated with other data on the Web; 
- to define a range of access patterns and encoding extensions** that cover a set of core use cases specified; 
- to identify and assess existing methods and tools; 
- to drive consensus on weather standards for the web;
- and to produce a set of best practice for use of weather information on the web.

This document describes a set of evolving use cases which are the first steps of working towards these goals. Members of the Sub Group and other stakeholders are working collaborativly to define a number of use cases that describe how weather information on the Web could work. From these use cases, a number of requirements for further work are derived. In this document, use cases, requirements and their relationships will be described. Requirements and use cases are also related to the deliverables of the Sub Group.

The requirements described in this document will be the basis for development of the other deliverables of the Sub Group.

## 3. Deliverables
The deliverables of this Working Group are described in the Working Group Charter. For convenience those deliverables are replicated in this chapter. The charter remains the authoritative source of the definition of deliverables.

- 3.1 Use Cases and Requirements
A document setting out the range of problems that the Sub Group are trying to solve (this document).

- 3.2 Weather on the Web Best Practices
A range of examples and desceiptions of how to integrate weather information on the web.

- 3.3 Business Case
Outlining the benefits of Weather on the Web

- 3.4 Core Specification
A document describing the standard specification required to meet the needs of the use cases

## 4. Use Cases

### Use Case - Simple point data
**Contributed by:** @RichCarne

**Full Use Case description:**
Web application developers require convenient and consistent interface to request weather data for a specified point on the surface of the earth. The encoding format should also be consistent to enable data to be sourced from a range of weather sources.
